# RentScout

RentScout is an app that allows people to list apartments and homes for sublet, short, and long-term rentals. Users can search the listings based on specified criteria. 

## User Requirements

Your application must meet the following user requirements:

- A user (Listing) can create an account

- If a user (Listing) deletes their account, associated property listings are removed

- A user (Listing) can add properties with location, prices, and images (up to three)

- Users must be logged in to list a property.

- A user (Searching) can find properties without logging in. 

- A user (Searching) create an account and save properties that they are interested in. 

- A user (Searching) can filter properties based on price, location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and pet friendly or not pet friendly. 

- A user (Searching) will be presented with a list of eligible properties that meet their criteria. 

- A user (Searching) can see details about a property on the list by clicking on it.
